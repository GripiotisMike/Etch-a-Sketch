# Etch a Sketch - Python Project

A simple **Etch a Sketch** app built using Python and the **Turtle graphics** module. This app allows users to control a turtle (acting as a drawing pen) using the keyboard to draw on the screen. Users can also reset the drawing or move the turtle in different directions.

## Features

- **Movement**: Control the turtle's movement with the arrow keys and custom keys.
- **Drawing**: As the turtle moves, it leaves a trail that mimics the drawing action.
- **Reset**: Clear the screen and reset the drawing when needed.
- **Keyboard Input**: The app listens to specific keys to move the turtle.
